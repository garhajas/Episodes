A simple RDBMS for showcasing how to store and retrieve info about TV shows, actors, salary etc.
The ER Diagram is a visual repersentation of what the schema does. 
I used the data.sql file (provided by York University) to pouplate my tables (schema)
Lastly I performed a query (query.sql) on my schema to check the schema's validity
  answer.txt is the output created by the query.
